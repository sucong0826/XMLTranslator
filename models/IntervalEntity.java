/**
 * An IntervalEntity wants to express a segment of intervals.
 * Such as 0 - 100 is-even, that is, an interval segment maybe indicates 0 - 20.
 * <p>
 * An interval entity has several attributesï¼š
 * `interval` has five attributes which are id, is-even, root-type, start,end.
 * ` id:           id is a unique identifier to indicate the interval is the only one existing in this xml config.
 * ` is-even:      indicating that whether the distribution is even or not. true means even, false otherwise.
 * ` root-type:    root-type is an enumeration type. It means the situations of values of boundaries.
 * It has three enums:
 * ` inclusive_exclusive
 * ` exclusive_inclusive
 * ` exclusive_exclusive
 * ` start:        start is a value of integer type which means that the start value of interval. Such as 0 as general one.
 * ` end:          end is a value of integer type which means that the end value of interval. Such as 100 as general one.
